## ~~ようこそ。このワルドへ…~~

Hello! I am a computer science student at Nanjing University.

As an early-stage programmer, I am interested in exploring various topics in
computer science and gradually building a technical foundation.
I enjoy experimenting, reading, and thinking about both theory and practice.

I also maintain a [**personal blog**](https://youngsirspace.github.io/) where I write about my learning notes and thoughts.
It is still a work under development, but you are very welcome to take a look.
